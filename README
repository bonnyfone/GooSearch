This is may be a simpler way to search the web using Google Search API and Java.

What do you need to use the library:
-a Custom Search API key (get one at https://code.google.com/apis/console)
-a Custom Search Engine id (create one at http://www.google.com/cse/manage/create and remember to activate the option "search the entire web" inside)
-GSON library in your build path (http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)


Look at the Test.java file to see how to use the library.
